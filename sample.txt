"To measure is to know"
"If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it."
"When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers,
you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot
express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind."

Lord Kelvin
